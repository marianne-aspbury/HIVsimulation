# HIVsimulation
 Scripts used for HIV simulation work.
 
  * Report describing aims, methods and initial progress is in **'Project_Report'** folder. Report includes various simple examples for illustration, and the original figures used are in a subfolder.

  * Key data and main, linked, set of scripts to run simulations and inferences in **'Main_Collection'** folder. Original transmission network csv too large to upload, so only pickled data in Individual Class format is provided here.

  * Old, work-in-progress scripts (different methods, or stages to develop different aspects/learning) and related files in **'Older_progress'** folder.
